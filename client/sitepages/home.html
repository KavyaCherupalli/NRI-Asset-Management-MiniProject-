<p class="p"><i>There are a lot of Non-Resident Indians(NRI's) who are working in various countries like USA, UK, Germany etc. owing to work, study or migration. Many of them do buy a lot of assets in their home country India with a long term plan of returning to India after they retire or simply as investment options. With the exponential growth of population, there are increasing incidents of double registrations, frauds like illegal occupancy against lands purchased. Specifically, if the land remains unattended for a couple of months or years, then there are greater chances of the land being prone to illegal occupancy.
